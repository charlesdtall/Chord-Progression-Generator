This app will eventually generate chord progressions that are statistically likely to sound pleasing. To do this, it will randomly select sequences of chords which each choice being weighted based on how common it is, which can be narrowed down using filters by genre, period, progression length, etc.

Notes are represented by numbers 0 - 11. Chords rooted on 0 default to I so that progressions can be key-agnostic, and C because some progressions in the database use chord symbols transposed to C and some us RN Analysis, idk, we'll see.

Eventually I want to also have the app recognize relative motion as being equivalent. For example, the Axis Progression (I-V-vi-IV) is commonly started on I and vi. Starting on vi, it's a minor progression that could also be analyzed as i-bVI-bIII-bVII. Not so sure how to get this code to recognize that I-V-vi-IV = i-bVI-bIII-bVII, but recognizing relative relationships like this is important to Chord Loop Theory (see [Patricia Taxxon's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-XSTSnqXxo) on the topic for more info).
